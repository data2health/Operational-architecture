# Operational-architecture
An internal project aimed at developing single source of truth workflows for program management.

## Problem statement
It is difficult to track what is going on in CD2H, to see progress, to understand impact or outcomes. 

## Project description
This project aims to create a variety of dashboard views and data feeds to help both technical and non-technical team members, community members, and NCATs readily see what is happening in CD2H and navigate to the information of most interest or salient use to them.

## Team members 

No action required here, a list of team members will be imported and linked below.

See https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/tree/master/team.md

## Repositories

List all of the Github repositories associated with the project. Each project requires at least one repository to house the project management layer. The "PM layer" constitutes the readme.md, education.md, evaluation.md, engagment.md as well as the milestones and issues.

You can either add the PM layer to an existing repository, or create a new repository for this and instead list the associated repositories below. Please be sure to tag any related repositories (whether or not they are already under the data2health organization) with the topic 'data2health'. The repository associated with the PM layer must be public. Other repositories associated with the project (where applicable) may be private for reasons of sensitivity or privacy. 

### Example repos:
This list can be omitted if you have only one repo (one and the same with the PM layer).
Otherwise, list the other project-associated repos that live inside or outside the data2health GitHub organization.
Note that only one repo per project needs to contain the PM layer. That is to say, don't add education to every repo in a project etc.

## Deliverables
Deliverables are defined as work products accessible on and after completion of the project, and include documents, code repositories, web services, etc. Typically milestones build towards deliverables, but are not deliverables per se.

Each project should propose one or more deliverables. Examples: a released code package, a best practices document, a final survey, a set of survey results, etc.

Each deliverable should include a description (or bulleted list) of the functionality of said deliverable.  For example, “The Competitions tool supports recruitment of external reviewers and submission of their reviews”.


## Milestones 

Think of each milestone like a sprint; a collection of issues to guide the development of the work and help us track the progress.

Each deliverable is represented as a Milestone, but not all Milestones need be deliverables. For example, see this 'report on XYZ' is a [Deliverable Milestone](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/milestone/2)

Please create 4-8 Milestones for each project, with dates prior to August 31st.  Milestones for partially completed deliverables are acceptable: beta release of software, # interviews performed, 75% coverage, etc. 

Each Milestone must have at least one Issue (aka 'ticket'), each issue should be assigned to a person, preferably one at a time; reassignments are fine. Issues with checklists showing degree of completion are also acceptable, see [example](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/issues/2).

Feel free to reference a key milestone here if you want, but don't go into detail about milestones here in the readme, you'll need to create each milestone separately by going to the issues list for your for your and clicking the milestones button. GitHub help on Milestones is [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-milestones-for-issues-and-pull-requests/).

## Evaluation
Each project should propose a set of evaluation measures, recorded in a separate Evaluation Plan file, for example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/evaluation.md). These will be reviewed by the Evaluation committee and approved by the Program Directors and NCATS. The Evaluation committee will meet with each Project team leads to assist. 

Each project should have Evaluation-realated issues, that can be labeled with the "evaluation" label (aka tag). see [Example Evaluation Issue](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/issues/5)

## Education
See [education.md](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/education.md) for details. Each project should have Education-realated issues, that can be labeled with the "education" label. 

## Get involved
We encourage the community to get involved. 

We require all CD2H projects to have non-CD2H CTSA participants, as CD2H is a CTSA coordinating center. Each project should include an Engagement plan file, example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/engagement.md). 

Please label any engagment related issues with "engagement" label.

## Working documents
Documentation may be natively in GitHub using the wiki or .md files in the appropriate folder, or in Google Drive.
[Documentating projects in Github](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/)

[The project Google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1vLp-H32KTNobiZF2cK82At90S6dVJNUf) is accessible to onboarded participants. 

## Slack channel
The project slack channel [#yourChannelNameHere](link to your channel here) is accessible to onboarded participants. You will *not* automatically be added to Slack; however, we encourage you to please join via the link you are emailed when you onboard (bit.ly/cd2h-onboarding-form).
