# Operational-architecture
An internal project aimed at developing single source of truth workflows for program management.

## Problem statement
It is difficult to track what is going on in CD2H, to see progress, to understand impact or outcomes. 

## Project description
This project aims to create a variety of dashboard views and data feeds to help both technical and non-technical team members, community members, and NCATS readily see what is happening in CD2H and navigate to the information of most interest or salient use to them.

## Deliverables

- Dashboard overview of all past and current CD2H projects, with their milestones and milestone progress indicated
- Information feed to the CD2H website, highlighting to non-technical users what CD2H is working on
- Content feeds for newsletter and RPPR population
- NCATS Gsuite launched for CD2H 

## Evaluation
The operational architecture will have an evaluation plan, but this has not yet been developed. 

## Education
The operational architecture per se does not intend to have any educational attributes. The Admin core as a whole will be responsible for educational engagement as it cross-cuts several projects in different ways. 

## Get involved
The operational architecture does not intend to have any outside engagement. The Admin core as a whole will be developing a robust engagement plan. 

## Working documents
Documents for this effort primarily reside in Github; however, a google drive folder is [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/13c-PzAYryBD88caoJsEoY-t_FEsnmT5d).
