# Research Design
This project aims to create a variety of dashboard views and data feeds to help both technical and non-technical team members, community members, and NCATS readily see what is happening in CD2H and navigate to the information of most interest or salient use to them. The design is intended to be nimble with regard to technology and project evolution. As projects within CD2H come and go, and involve an increasing number of community participants, we expect the dashboarding needs to also evolve. We want to be able to highlight archived projects that have moved on to dissemination phases, de-emphasize but still make available projects that have been put on hold, and promote the addition and enhancement of new projects from the community.

# Methodology

The main methods are the combined use of Github for project tracking and community engagement, and automated information feeds to/from Gsuite documents and forms. We also plan to provide dashboard views for the NCATS CD2H website, which is currently implemented as a Wordpress site. We will consider replacing the site with either a Github.io site or possibly Drupal, to improve the functionality and increase team contributions. 

# Expected Outcomes

* Dashboard overview of all past and current CD2H projects, with their milestones and milestone progress indicated
* Information feed to the CD2H website, highlighting to non-technical users what CD2H is working on
* Content feeds for newsletter and RPPR population
* All CD2H paid staff onboarded to NCATS Gsuite; key/current CD2H content migrated and organized; stretch goal: community members also onboarded

# Deliverables

- Dashboard overview of all past and current CD2H projects, with their milestones and milestone progress indicated

# Potential Pitfalls and Alternative Strategies
One of the goals of the move to doing the project management in Github was that there was a need for transparency, both for project management purposes but also for community engagement and contributions. One potential pitfall is that we have simply migrated the project management to Github but not the actual work itself. The dashboards will still likely be useful as an overview of progress on issues and milestones in this case, but if the actual codebases are not in Github it will be difficult to assess things like contributions, code completeness, activity, and most importantly, they will not provide the much needed opportunity for community contributions. A strategy to address this problem is to use one of the synchonization tools that can synchronize ticketing systems such as Jira or Redmine to Github, and to create public shadow repositories for the work. We will also provide training to help people get used to using Github for their work. Finally, we will explore the opposite synchronization strategies - pushing content back to institutional Jira instances or other work tracking systems.
